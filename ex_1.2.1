            a       b       t
        
initial |   5   |   7   |        |
t = a   |   5   |       |    5   |
b = t   |       |   5   |    5   |
a = b   |   5   |   5   |    5   |

As a consequence, a = b = t = 5 has just been proved. this 3 lines conduct aligning any value assigned to a and b to be same value. Especially a value is prefered as reference value.
